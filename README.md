# PacMen_Factory
## Making Unlimitted PacMen

```It's fun game.```

## How to Run
1. Click "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman would show up at a random position on the screen.
2. Click "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen show up and would start dancing at random speed on the screen.
3. When a pacman hits the edge of the screen, it would change position to stay within the window frame of the web page.
4. You could add as many as pacmen in the game.

## Roadmap of future improvements
> Plan to improve the PacMan image and background screen to make it more attractive
